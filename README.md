# 📘 Kotlin Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Kotlin learning repository! This project serves as a journal and sandbox to document my progress, experiments, and learnings as I dive into Kotlin programming.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository includes:

- ✏️ **Practice Exercises** – Small code snippets and solutions to improve my understanding.
- 🧪 **Mini Projects** – Simple applications to apply what I’ve learned.
- 📚 **Notes & References** – Key concepts, language features, and useful resources.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
To run the Kotlin files, you'll need:

- Kotlin compiler or An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

You can find the compiler and install instructions **[here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html)**\
To compile and run from the command line:
```bash
filename.kt -include-runtime -d filename.jar
java -jar filename.jar
```

I’m using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Kotlin plugin to write and run all code.  
In most cases, you can just open a `.kt` file and click the **Run** icon.

If you're not using an IDE, you can also use the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) for quick experiments.

## 📚 Resources I’m Using

- [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview)
- [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18)
- [Kotlin YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kotlin+tutorial)

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

This repository helps me:

- Track my learning progress
- Keep code organized
- Reflect on what I’ve learned
- Build a personal reference I can revisit later
